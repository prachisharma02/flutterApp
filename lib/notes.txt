flutter has two types of animation
1. physics based
2. tween
physics based animation is used to mimic real world behaviour  for example when an object is 
dropped and hits the ground it will bounce and continue to move forward but with each bounce it continues 
to slow down with smaller rebounds and eventually stop  as the object get closer with each bounds the velocity 
incraese but height dcerease 
tween is the short for in between meaning that animation has beginning and ending a timeline curve 
that specifiesthe timing and speed of the transition , the framework automatically calculates the 
transition frm beginning to end 
hero me hme do screen define krni padti hai but animation me ek he screen m hojata hai

using Animatedopacity
if you need to  hide or partially hide a widget animated opacity is a great way to animate fading
over time it takes parameter opacity duration curve and child 

Curved animation
it is used to define the progression of an animation class as anon linear curve we can use this to modify
an existing animation by changing its interpolation method it is also used when we want to use a differnet 
curve when playing an animation 

using drag and drop widget
you implemented drag and drop feature by using the draggable and drag target  widget these widgets are used in
conjuction. The dragg widget able widget has a data property that passes information to the drag target widget the drag 
target widget can accept or refuse the data which gives you the ability to check for the correct data format 
in this example you dragged the paint palette icon (draggable) over the text (dragtarget) and once you let ground
the text color changes to red 

The Dismissible widget listens to vertical and horizotal dragging gestures. By using the dismisDirection 
for the direction property you can limit which dragging gestures you listen to such as restricting to 
horizontal-only gestures
