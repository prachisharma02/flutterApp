flutter has two types of animation
1. physics based
2. tween
physics based animation is used to mimic real world behaviour  for example when an object is 
dropped and hits the ground it will bounce and continue to move forward but with each bounce it continues 
to slow down with smaller rebounds and eventually stop  as the object get closer with each bounds the velocity 
incraese but height dcerease 
tween is the short for in between meaning that animation has beginning and ending a timeline curve 
that specifiesthe timing and speed of the transition , the framework automatically calculates the 
transition frm beginning to end
